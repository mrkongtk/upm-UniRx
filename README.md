# upm-UniRx

Welcome to UPM UniRx, a project that brings [UniRx](https://github.com/neuecc/UniRx) from the Unity package format into UPM (Unity Package Manager) format. This project aims to provide the same functionality as the original UniRx without modifying any code. Additional package information has been included by me. If you have any concerns, please feel free to submit a pull request. If you prefer using the Unity package, please visit the original repository to download it.

Here are some important details:

- Latest Version: [7.1.0](https://github.com/neuecc/UniRx/releases/tag/7.1.0)
- Unity Version during import: [2022.3.4f1](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2022.3.4)
